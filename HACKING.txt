We're using python 3 because fuck it, we can. Please don't add python 2
compatibility (unless we really take off and users actually want that).

This is to be library agnostic (e.g. not using `twisted.internet.defer` or
`tornado.concurrent.futures` (or whatever it is); asyncio might be feasible in
future if people start writing adapters for it to all of the other async
libraries).
